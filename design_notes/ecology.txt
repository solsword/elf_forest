  - Anti-predator: basic defenses


Energy sources:
  - Autotrophic:
    - photosynthesis (requires sunlight)
    - thaumoconversion (requires magical flux)
    - chemosynthesis (requires chemical substrate)
  - Symbiotic:
    - symbiotic absorption (requires symbiont)
  - Parasitic:
    - parasitic absorption (requires victim)
  - Saprotrophic:
    - saprotrophic digestion (requires decaying matter)
  - Holozoic:
    - detrivorous digestion (requires decaying matter)
    - herbivorous digestion (requires plants)
    - carnivorous digestion (requires prey)

Nutrient sources:
  - Detritus absorption (requires decaying matter)
  - Herbivorous digestion (requires plants)
  - Insectivorous digestion (requires insects)
  - Carnivorous digestion (requires prey)
  - Parasitic absorption (requires victim)
  - Symbiotic absorption (requires symbiont)

Water sources:

  - Water (requires aqueous environment)

Anti-disease:
  - Basic resistance

Anti-parasite:
  - Basic resistance
  - Symbiont strategy (requires parasite-eating symbiont)

Anti-predator:
  - Outgrow strategy (requires fast growth/broad proliferation)
  - Poison strategy (requires poisonous tissue)
  - Tough strategy (requires tough tissues)
  - Thorns strategy (requires thorns)
  - Grand-predator attraction strategy (requires grand-predator)
  - Grouping strategy (requires coordination & communication)
  - Camouflage strategy (requires appropriate coloration/behavior)
  - Mimicry strategy (requires suitable mimic subject)
