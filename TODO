performance
  optimize the chunk load queue and load_surroundings
  optimize exposure computation by caching block results (27-element array)
  double-check octree performance
  time chunk loading
  render ordering of chunks
  support path caching
  dynamic load capping
loading
  implement dynamic chunk loading
  implement player position management
  separate loading/compiling of chunks
physics
  entity collision detection
  swimming upwards when pressing against a wall vs. not
terrain
  forests
    simplex object noise
  caves
  erosion
  block support
graphics
  fix png vs. ppm 90-degree rotation
  use or disable texture mipmapping
  voxel mipmapping
    better block averaging
    better edge behavior?
    advanced sampling techniques?
  block lighting
    ambient occlusion
  entity models & textures
  initial player facing due to initial mouse movement
  implement wrapped simplex noise (optional)
  check for z reconciliation problems (esp. at corners of secondary solid
    blocks)
world
  plant growth
  water flow
gameplay
  glyphs
  songs
  plants
  smell
  sounds (directional; slow pathfinding)
bugs/testing
  edge-of-chunk lighting and transparency issues
  far away chunk block size
  bad transparency layering (before/behind the player when in water with
    abstract water below).
  fix abstracted chunk adjacency+transparency
  test for bugs near the region origin
  double-stepping when traversing a corner precisely
  add arbitrary vertex buffer lists
  gencolumn job is buggy (run valgrind --track-origins=yes)
misc
  coppicing
  Cistercian monks
  copper and its alloys have anti-microbial properties
processes
  no-till farming
  limestone flux supplies both CO2 and CaO in a blast furnace
    carbon from coke/charcoal provides CO and C to turn CO2 into CO
    CaO + SiO2 -> CaSiO3

    curing, breaking, and scutching
    produces shives (fuel; wallboard) and tow (paper; stuffing)
  cementation to produce brass from copper and gaseous zinc
materials
  H2S (stinkdamp) reacts with alcohol to produce thiols
